# Workflow

This *repo* has got a branch named `dev`, which is a descendant of the `main` branch.  
The `dev` branch is where all of the features are implemented unitil the game goes into deploy phase.  
  
**ALL OF THE FEATURE BRANCHES SHOULD BE DESCENDANT OF `dev`!!!**  

To start coding a feature:

- Create a new branch with the naming standard `feature/{name-of-the-feature}`

Whenever the feature is done the branch should be merged with the `dev` branch.  
A feature branch's lifetime should be as short as possible: as soon as the feature is ready to implement create a pull request.

**NOTHING SHOULD BE COMMITED TO** ´main´**!!!**
Unless it's documentation related files.
